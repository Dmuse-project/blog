                <h1 class="text">What are Electrical Loads?</h1>
                <p class="text">Electrical Load are  devices which takes electrical energy. In other words,  electrical load are devices that consumes electrical energy in the form of the current and transforms it into other forms like heat, light, work, etc.Electrical loads may be resistive, inductive, capacitive or some combination between them. The term load is used in the number of ways.


 
                    To indicates a device or a collection of the equipment which use electrical energy.
                    For showing the power requires from a given supply circuit.
                    The electrical load indicates the current or power passing through the line or machine.
                    The classifications of loads are shown in the figure below.

                    Types of Electrical Loads
                    The nature of the load depends on the load factor, demand factor, diversity factor, power factor, and a utilisation factor of the system. The different types of load are explained below in details.</p>
          
                    <h1 class="text">Resistive Load</h1>
                    <p class="text">The resistive load obstructs the flow of electrical energy in the circuit and converts it into thermal energy, due to which the energy dropout occurs in the circuit. The lamp and the heater are the examples of the resistive load. The resistive loads take power in such a way so that the current and the voltage wave remain in the same phase. Thus the power factor of the resistive load remains in unity.

                        Inductive load
                        The inductive loads use the magnetic field for doing the work. The transformers, generators, motor are the examples of the load. The inductive load has a coil which stores magnetic energy when the current pass through it. The current wave of the inductive load is lagging behind the voltage wave, and the power factor of the inductive load is also lagging.

                        </p>

                        <h1 class="text">Capacitive Load</h1>
                        <p class="text">In the capacitive load, the voltage wave is leading the current wave. The examples of capacitive loads are capacitor bank, three phase induction motor starting circuit, etc. The power factor of such type of loads is leading.

                        <h1 class="text">Types of Electrical Loads in Power System</h1>
                        <p class="text">The total loads of an area depend on its population and living standard of the people. The different types of the loads in a power system are as follows.

                            Domestic load
                            Commercial load
                            Industrial load
                            Agriculture load</p>

                            <h1 class="text">Domestic Load</h1>
                            <p class="text">The domestic load is defined as the total energy consumed by the electrical appliances in the household work. It depends on the living standard, weather and type of residence. The domestic loads mainly consist of lights, fan, refrigerator, air conditioners, mixer, grinder, heater, ovens, small pumping, motor, etc. The domestic load consume very little power and also independent from frequency. This load largely consists of lighting, cooling or heating.</p>

                            <h1 class="text">Commercial Load </h1>
                            <p class="text">Commercial load mainly consist of lightning of shops, offices, advertisements, etc.,  Fans, Heating, Air conditioning and many other electrical appliances used in establishments such as market restaurants, etc. are considered as a commercial load.</p>


                            <h1 class="text">Industrial Loads</h1>
                            <p class="text">Industrial load consists of small-scale industries, medium scale industries, large scale industries, heavy industries and cottage industries. The induction motor forms a high proportion of the composite load. The industrial loads are the composite load. The composite load is a function of frequency and voltage and its form a major part of the system load.</p>


                            <h1 class="text">Agriculture Loads</h1>
                            <p class="text">This type of load is mainly motor pumps-sets load for irrigation purposes. The load factor of this load is very small e.g. 0.15 – 0.20.</p>

                            <h1 class="text">Understanding Electrical Capacity</h1>
                            <p class="text">Calculating how much power your home needs is a matter of calculating the amperage load of all the various appliances and fixtures, then building in a margin of safety. Generally, it's recommended that the load never exceeds 80 percent of the electrical service's capacity.

                                To use the math, you need to understand the relationship between watts, volts, and amps. These three common electrical terms have a mathematical relationship that can be expressed in a couple of different ways:
                                
                                Volts x Amps = Watts
                                Amps = Watts/Volts
                                These formulas can be used to calculate the capacity and loads of individual circuits, as well as for the entire electrical service. For example, a 20-amp, 120-volt branch circuit has a total capacity of 2,400 watts (20 amps x 120 volts). Since the standard recommendation is for the load to total no more than 80 percent of the capacity, this means that the 20-amp circuit has a realistic capacity of 1920 watts. So to avoid the danger of circuit overloads, all the light fixtures and plug-in appliances together on this circuit should consume no more than 1,920 watts of power.
                                
                                It is fairly easy to read the wattage ratings of the lightbulbs, television sets, and other appliances on the circuit to determine if a circuit is likely to overload. For example, if you routinely plug a 1500-watt space heater into a circuit, and run several light fixtures or lamps with 100-watt bulbs on the same circuit, you have already used up most of the safe 1920-watt capacity.
                                
                                The same formula can be used to determine the capacity of the house's overall electrical service. Because a home's main service is 240 volts, the math looks like this:
                                
                                240 volts x 100 amps = 24,000 watts
                                80 percent of 24,000 watts = 19,200 watts
                                In other words, a 100-amp electrical service should be expected to provide no more than 19,200 watts of power load at any given time.</p>


                            <h1 class="text">Calculating Load</h1>
                            <p class="text">After you know the capacity of individual circuits and of the home's full electrical service, you can then compare this with the load, which you can calculate simply by adding up the wattage ratings of all the various fixtures and appliances that will be drawing power at the same time.

                                You might think this involves adding up the wattage of all the light fixture lightbulbs, all the plug-in appliances, and all the hard-wired appliances, and then comparing this to the total capacity. But it is rare for all electrical appliances and fixtures to run at the same time—you wouldn't run the furnace and the air conditioner at the same time, for example; nor is it be likely that you would be vacuuming while the toaster is running. For this reason, electricians generally have alternative methods for determining the appropriate size for the electrical service. Here is one method that is sometimes used:
                                
                                Add together the wattage capacity of all general lighting branch circuits.
                                Add in the wattage rating of all plug-in outlet circuits.
                                Add in the wattage rating of all permanent appliances (ranges, dryers, water heaters, etc.)
                                Subtract 10,000.
                                Multiply this number by .40
                                Add 10,000.
                                Look for the full wattage rating of permanent air conditioners, and the wattage rating heating appliances (furnace plus space heaters), then add in whichever is the larger of these two numbers. (You don't heat and cool at the same time, so don't need to add both numbers.)
                                Divide the total by 240.
                                This resulting number gives the suggested amperage needed to power the home adequately. You can easily evaluate your current electrical service by using this formula.
                                
                                Other electricians suggest another simple rule-of-thumb:
                                
                                100-amp service is generally large enough to power a small- to moderate-sized home's general branch circuits, plus one or two electric appliances, such as a range, water heater, or clothes dryer. This service may be sufficient for a home under 2,500 square feet if the heating appliances run on gas.
                                200-amp service will handle the same load as 100-amp service, plus electric appliances and electric heating/cooling equipment in homes up to about 3,000 square feet in size.
                                300- or 400-amp service is recommended for large homes (more than 3,500 square feet) with all-electric appliances and electric heating/cooling equipment. This service size is recommended where the expected electric heat load is over 20,000 watts. A 300- or 400-amp service is usually provided by installing two service panels—one providing 200 amps and a second providing another 100 or 200 amps.</p>
