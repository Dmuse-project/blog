                <h1 class="text">The dangers of improper electrical wiring</h1>
                <p class="text">Every year, improper, faulty or old electrical wiring causes home fires, leading to billions of dollars in property damage and in some cases, loss of life. In fact, improper electrical wiring and related equipment account for the largest share of home structure fires.it is important to be educated on the dangers of improper and old electrical wiring, and the experts at wiremasters are here to help! You should be especially mindful of the wiring in your residence if you live in an older home.</p>

                <h1 class="text">Dangers of faulty electrical wiring.</h1>
                <p class="text">Faulty electrical wiring can cause Fire
                    The most significant danger of faulty electric wiring is a fire breaking out. When electrical wires are loose, frayed, cracked, or overheated, they are unable to conduct electricity properly. This all too often leads to a fire breaking out. The scariest part of having faulty electrical wiring is that a fire can break out at any time! <br> <br>Faulty electrical wiring can cause a Short circuit
                    Faulty electrical wiring can cause a short circuit. A short circuit is when too much current flows through the electrical wiring and causes the electricity to stop working altogether. This can cause both blackouts and fires. <br> <br>Faulty electrical wiring can cause Electrocution
                    When electric wiring isn’t properly installed– or is exposed- it can be deemed as faulty. This faulty wiring can cause electrocution if someone comes in contact with it. Electrocution can range from minor to lethal. With so much load shedding we are prone to try and fix our appliances and electrical circuits ourselves, please call your local electrician and err on the safe side. </p>

                <h1 class="text">Problematic wiring</h1>
                <p class="text">There are a few main types of wiring that tend to be the most problematic.they are: <br> <br>Ungrounded wiring: often times this is more problematic in outlets with only two prongs instead of newer ones with three, ungrounded outlets can shock you or worse when the ground wire becomes energized. <br><br>Cloth cable wiring: before current insulators became the norm, this type of wiring was popular in residential structures and was sheathed in cloth or asbestos. <br><br>Knob or tube wiring: is at least 65 years old and fails to meet current electrical codes, this type of wiring uses air to dissipate heat, so any contact with home insulation poses a threat of fire. <br><br>Aluminum wiring: over time, aluminum expands and contracts as it heats and cools, with effects ranging from melted insulation to increased resistance or arcing, which leaves you at risk of shock or worse.
                    Most of the electrical wiring types discussed above do not meet current electrical codes and are not present in newer homes, but if you believe you may have one of the above types installed in your house, call us and one of our 5-star rated electricians will come by for an inspection.</p>
