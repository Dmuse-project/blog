                <h1 class="text">What does electricty entails?</h1>
                <p class="text">Electricity is the phenomenon associated with stationary or moving electric charges. Electric charge is a fundamental property of matter and is borne by elementary particles. In electricity the particle involved is the electron, which carries a charge designated, by convention, as negative. Thus, the various manifestations of electricity are the result of the accumulation or motion of numbers of electrons.
                However, electricity is simply a form of energy resulting from the existence of charged particles(such as protons and electrons),either sttically as an accumulation of charge or dynamically as a current. 
                inother words...The movement of electric charge is known as an electric current, the intensity of which is usually measured in amperes. Current can consist of any moving charged particles; most commonly these are electrons, but any charge in motion constitutes a current. Electric current can flow through some things, electrical conductors, but will not flow through an electrical insulator.

                <h1 class="text">History of electricity in Nigeria.</h1>
                <p class="text">Electricity generation in Nigeria began in Lagos in 1886 with the use of generators to provide 60 kW. In 1923 tin miners installed a 2 MW plant on the Kwali River, six years later, the Nigerian Electricity Supply Company, a private firm was established near Jos to manage a hydroelectric plant at Kura to power the mining industry. Then another private enterprise was established in Sapele by United Africa Company to power the activities of African Timber and Plywood Company. Between 1886 and 1945, electric power generation was rather low with power provided largely to Lagos and other commercial centers such as mining industries in Jos and Enugu. The colonial government created an electricity department within the Public Works Department which then installed generating sets in many cities to serve government reservation areas and commercial centers. In 1950, the Legislative Council of Nigeria began moves to integrate the electricity industry when it enacted a law to establish the Electricity Corporation of Nigeria (ECN) with the duties of developing and supplying electricity. ECN took over the electricity sector activities within PWD and the generating sets of Native Authorities. In 1951, the firm managed 46 MW of electricity. Between 1952 and 1960, the firm established coal-powered turbines at Oji and Ijora, Lagos and began making preliminary plans for a transmission network to link the power generating sites with other commercial centers. In 1961, ECN completed a 132 kV transmission line linking Lagos to Ibadan via Shagamu, in 1965, this line was extended to Oshogbo, Benin, and Ughelli to form the Western System.[6]

                    In 1962, a statutory organization, the Niger Dams Authority (NDA) was formed to build and maintain dams along River Niger and Kaduna River, NDA went on to commission a 320 MW hydropower plant at Kainji in 1969 with the power generated sold to ECN. In 1972 NDA and ECN merged to form the National Electric Power Authority (NEPA). NEPA was the major electricity firm in Nigeria until power sector reforms resulted in the creation of the Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN) and later privatization of electricity generation and distribution.</p>

                    <h1 class="text"> Power Sectors in Nigeria.</h1>
                    <p class="text">The electricity sector in Nigeria generates, transmits and distributes megawatts(MW) of electric power that is significantly less than what is needed to meet basic household and industrial needs. Nigeria has twenty-three power generating plants connected to the national grid with the capacity to generate 11,165.4 MW of electricity. These plants are managed by generation companies (GenCos), independent power providers, and Niger Delta Holding Company. In 2012, the industry labored to distribute 5,000 MW, very much less than the 40,000 MW needed to sustain the basic needs of the population. This deficit is also exacerbated by unannounced load shedding, partial and total system collapse and power failure. To meet demand, many households and businesses resort to purchasing generating sets to power their properties,this source of energy provided 6,000 MW in 2008.</p>

                    <p class="text">Nigeria has twenty-three  power generating plants connected to the national grid with the capacity to generate 11,165.4 MW of electricity. These plants are managed by generation companies (GenCos), independent power providers, and Niger Delta Holding Company. The primary independent power plants before the power sector reforms are Shell-owned Afam VI (642MW), Agip-built Okpai plant (480 MW), and AES (270 MW). The third sector is the Nigerian National Integrated Power Project, NIPP, a project that was initiated in 2004 to fast-track the development of new power plants in the country. The majority of the new proposed plants are gas-powered plants. In 2014, the proposed capacity of NIPP plants was 5,455 MW.</p>

                        <h1 class="text">Distribution</h1>
                        <p class="text">In Nigeria, electrical power generated by the GenCos is used to power the grid through the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN). Electricity is distributed through the transmission of electric power from TCN to the distribution companies (DisCos) primary substations, then to the secondary distribution system, and finally to the end consumers. Alternating Current (AC) is used for the transmission of the electric power, this is because AC can be easily changed from one voltage to another with a small loss of energy with the use of transformer. The electric power is transmitted at high voltage (33kV) to the DisCos' primary substations in the six geopolitical zones based on the load allocation formula. The high voltage received is then stepped down to medium voltage (11kV) with the use of transformers. This medium voltage power is now transmitted to secondary distribution transformers near the consumer's residence. The secondary distribution transformers further step down the medium voltage to customers' consumption capacity (low voltage usually 220 to 240V). However, some customers for example industries and commercial customers like Flour mills, Refineries, steel rolling mills, cement factories, rice mills, etc may receive their power directly from the primary distribution line depending on their power utilization.</p>
                        <p class="text">Nigeria has eleven distribution companies.[17]
